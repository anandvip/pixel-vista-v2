This rewrite provides several improvements:

1. Modularity: The code is split into separate files, each with a specific responsibility.
2. Testability: Functions are pure where possible, making them easier to test.
3. State Management: We've implemented a simple state management system for the current page and search query.
4. Error Handling: Basic error handling is in place, which can be expanded upon.
5. Authentication Flow: The authentication process is more straightforward and integrated with the image viewing process.
6. Separation of Concerns: UI updates, data fetching, and business logic are separated.

To test this application:

1. Set up a local development server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or Node.js `http-server`).
2. Create unit tests for the pure functions in each module.
3. Use a tool like Jest for JavaScript testing.
4. Consider implementing end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress.

This structure allows for easier maintenance, testing, and future expansion of the PixelVista Explorer application. It addresses the concerns about testability and proper structuring for a modern web application.
